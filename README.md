# django-application

This was a pretty extensive project I did for Internet Programming. The assignment was to design an application using Django which included a model, some administrative interface customization, and a single view. The application model was based on a measurements example provided.

The model has classes Area, Location, Measurement, and Category which each have different returns.

The admin interface has only Area, Location, and Category on the main admin page. When you choose a Location, you'll be able to view the measurements for it.

The application supports a single view at /measurements and it presents a tabular summary of the data for all areas.

This can be imported as a Pycharm project.
